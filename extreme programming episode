im not too familiar with TDD currently whatsoever.
after reading i understand that TDD is writing code long with working on design and functionality
it shows me that there are strategic ways and lots of info on how code should be written. instead of throwing up on a paper you need it presentable. its literally a language of its own at the end of the day so treat it like one.
